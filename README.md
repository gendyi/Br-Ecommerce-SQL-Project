# Br-Ecommerce-SQL-Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is focused on analyzing an **e-commerce sales database** using SQL.  
The database was designed to include the main entities of a sales system such as **customers, orders, products, payments, and reviews**. The goal is to explore this data with SQL queries, generate insights about sales performance, and understand customer behavior and product trends.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
The analysis was carried out using **PostgreSQL** as the database engine, with **DBeaver** as the SQL client and management tool. All queries were written in SQL, covering both data definition (DDL) and data manipulation (DML).

## 📂 Project Structure
The project is organized into several folders to keep everything clear and structured:

- **data/** → Contains all the CSV files used to build the database.  
- **erd/** → Contains the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that illustrates the structure of the database and the relationships between tables.  
- **queries/** → Contains all the SQL queries used in the analysis, saved as `.sql` files.  
- **screenshots/** → Contains screenshots of selected queries along with their outputs.  

This structure makes it easy to navigate and understand the project components.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset simulates an e-commerce environment with several key tables:  

- **Customers**: Information about customers and their locations.  
- **Orders**: Details about orders, including order IDs and timestamps.  
- **Order Items**: Information about products included in each order.  
- **Products**: Categories and descriptions of available products.  
- **Payments**: Payment methods and values.  
- **Reviews**: Customer feedback and ratings for their orders.

## 📐 Entity Relationship Diagram
To design the database and better understand the relationships between entities, an ERD was created.  
It shows how **customers place orders, orders contain products, products belong to categories, payments are linked to orders, and customers provide reviews**.  
The diagram is available in the `erd/` folder for reference.

## 🔎 SQL Queries
A wide range of SQL queries were written to analyze the dataset and answer different business questions, such as:  

- How much sales revenue was generated by year and by month?  
- Which product categories are the top-selling?  
- What is the average delivery time per order?  
- How are customers distributed across regions?  
- What payment methods are most commonly used?  

All of these queries are available in the `queries/` folder, organized as `.sql` scripts for easy reuse.

---

## 📷 Screenshots
To showcase some of the results, screenshots of selected queries and their outputs were captured. These are stored in the `screenshots/` folder so you can quickly see examples of the analysis without running the queries yourself.
